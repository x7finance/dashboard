## Liquidity Lending Questions

### What are the loan terms?

The loan terms can be found on the [loan page here](/loans/)

### How do I take a loan

A loan can only currently be taken when you initially deploy your liquidity pair.

### Do I need to complete any forms to take a loan

No. Anyone at any time can deploy their project tokens using an ILL once there are funds in the lending pool.

### What happens when a initial liquidity loan (ILL) is taken

When an ILL is taken you will select the loan type and amount of ETH you wish to deploy your tokens into the liquidity pair with.

Each on of these will have a fixed leverage type against them which can be found on the [loan page here](/loans/)

When the transaction is processed the loan funds are automatically placed into the liquidity pair and you will receive the LP tokens for this pair.

### What happens if I donâ€™t pay the loan

You will default on the loan and the ETH will be removed from the liquidity pair.

The liquidity pair will still function and be tradeable at all times even if you default on the loan

### Is there a fee for taking a loan?

Yes there is an originator fee which goes back into the ecosystem to support other projects

### What happens if there is no funds in the lending pool and I want to deploy using a loan

In this case, when you make your request for a loan an NFT will be minted a fee in line with your loan. An outside investor can then purchase this NFT with the funds will be used for your loan.
