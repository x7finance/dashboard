## Multi Chain Airdrop

### What do I need to do to qualify for the airdrop?

Holders of X7 tokens on the Ethereum chain, will be eligible for the airdrop on BSC, Arbitrum, Optimsim and Polygon chains 

Simply hold the tokens, and you will receive the airdrop. The contract addresses are identical on all chains

### When will the airdrop happen?

You will have fair warning in the form of a non-extended timelock and the setting and freezing of the destination from these contracts into an airdropper/launch contract. The timelock + frozen destination mechanism will ensure that investors and researchers have ample time to evaluate the plan and determine their strategy.

### When will X7 tokens go live on the four new chains?

The tokens will not go live until we have built up a sufficient amount of initial liquidity for the tokens on any particular chain.

### Can I take a cash payout on Ethereum, rather than receiving the airdrop?

When the tokens do go live all X7 token holders on Ethereum will be airdropped vested tokens and/or be given an opportunity to take a cash payout for their share of tokens. We will set prices and payouts to ensure that there will be no incentive to exit an Ethereum X7 Token position in order to gain an "early" L1 or L2 ecosystem X7 token position. On the contrary, the more tokens held on Ethereum, the greater the reward will be when the tokens and ecosystem are released on other chains.
