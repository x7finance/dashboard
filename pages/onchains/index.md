title: On-chain Messages
---

The stealth launch story of X7 Finance has been heralded as an "incredible way to launch a project in this day and age". The on-chain, decentralized communications from X7's global collective of developers to the community provide chronological evidence on how the X7 community and ecosystem was born - and how the foundation has been built.

On-chain messaging through the blockchain ensures the protocol remains censorship-resistant. X7's combination of censorship-resistance, purely decentralized token ownership and governance, and a fair launch ensures that this paradigm-shifting technology and smart contract ecosystem thrives long into the future. Given the recent backdrop of global events, including multiple failures of the largest centralized exchanges and government censorship, this value system has never been more important.
